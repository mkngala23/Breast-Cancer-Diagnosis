The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, with 569 instances, is pivotal for developing predictive models to distinguish between benign and malignant breast cancer diagnoses. Each instance in the dataset corresponds to a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, digitally imaged and quantitatively described by 30 features that characterize the cell nuclei present. This study presents a robust predictive model based on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset provided by the University of California, Irvine. The dataset contains 569 samples, each labeled as benign (B) or malignant (M), with an unbalanced distribution of 63% to 37%, respectively. The features, computed from digitized images of FNA of breast masses, include 30 numerical predictors describing cellular characteristics such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. Relationship between predictors will be explored to look for those with high correlation to ensure that an effective machine learning model can be built; both linear and nonlinear classification models will be built based on training and testing data set, then we will choose the best model for each and their variables and finally the ultimate model will be chosen from both the linear and nonlinear classification model.
